Project Title: ezRemedy – Unified Healthcare Access Platform

Project Description:

ezRemedy is a unified digital health platform designed to bridge the gap between patients and essential medical services. While the broader vision of the project encompasses medicine delivery and electronic health records, the current live prototype focuses on the core module: a functional, user-centric Appointment Booking System. This module addresses the immediate need for patients to secure medical consultations without administrative friction.

The submitted web application features a fully responsive, "Nearby Doctor" discovery interface. Users can select from a curated list of specialists—including Cardiologists, General Physicians, and Pediatricians—complete with simulated distance data to help patients find the closest care. The system includes a robust booking engine that captures essential patient details, preferred dates, and specific medical reasons for the visit. To ensure a seamless user experience (UX), the platform utilizes real-time form validation to prevent booking errors (such as selecting past dates) and generates an instant digital confirmation summary upon successful submission, simulating the backend response of a full-scale hospital management system.

Technically, the project is built as a lightweight, static web solution hosted on GitHub Pages, ensuring high availability and fast load times even on slower networks. In strict adherence to the PBL evaluation guidelines, the interface also integrates a custom-built Presentation Auto-Timer, which aids in time management during the project defense. This prototype demonstrates the foundational frontend architecture of ezRemedy, proving the feasibility of a simplified, hassle-free medical service that prioritizes accessibility and ease of use for all patients.
